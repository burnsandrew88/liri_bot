# liri_bot

## This application functions just like Siri, but instead of using voice inputs from the user, it takes in written requests by using the following commands-
            Spotify-this-song
            concert-this
            movie-this
            do-what-it-says

### play around with these requests by typing in node liri.js in your command terminal with Node.js package loaded up and have a great time!
